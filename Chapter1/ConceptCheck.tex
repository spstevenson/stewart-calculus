		% Q1
		\item
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item What is a function? What are its domain and range?

			A function maps a set of inputs to a set of outputs. 

			A function is a rule that assigns each element $x$ in a
			set $D$ exactly one element, called $f(x)$ in a set $E$.

			The domain is the set $D$ of input elements of the function. The
			range is the set $E$ of output values.

			\item What is the graph of a function?

			A graph is a graphical representation of a function that shows
			the domain (usually on the $x$-axis) to the output values in
			the range $y$-axis via a curve.

			\item How can you tell whether a given curve is the graph of
			a function?

			A curve is a graph of the function if it passes the vertical line
			test. If any vertical passes through two or more points, the curve
			is not the graph of a function.
		\end{enumerate}

		% Q2 TODO
		\item Discuss four ways of representing a function. Illustrate your
			discussion with examples.

		% Q3
		\item
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item What is an even function? How can you tell if a function
				is even by looking at its graph? Give three examples
				of an even function?

				An even function is one where $f(x) = f(-x)$. An even
				function id symmetrical around the $y$-axis. Three
				even functions are $f(x) = x^2$, $g(x) = \cos x$ and
				$h(x) = |x|$.

			\item What is an odd function? How can you tell a function is
				odd by looking at its graph? Give examples of an odd
				function?

				An odd function is one where $f(x) = -f(-x)$. An odd
				function is symmetrical about the origin. Three
				odd functions are $f(x) = x^3$, $g(x) = \sin x$ and
				$h(x) = x$.
		\end{enumerate}

		% Q4
		\item What is an increasing function?
		
		An increasing function is one where $f(x_1) < f(x_2)$ whenever $x_1 < x_2$.

		% Q5
		\item What is a mathematical model?

		A mathematical model is a set of equations or mathematical expressions that
		describe a real world phenomena or problem. We can derive mathematical 
		conclusions from mathematical models.

		% Q6
		\item Give an example of each type of function.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Linear function

				$$f(x) = x + 3$$

			\item Power function

				$$f(x) = x^3$$

			\item Exponential function

				$$f(x) = e^x$$

			\item Quadratic function

				$$f(x) = x^2 + x + 1$$

			\item Polynomial of degree 5

				$$f(x) = x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$$

			\item Rational function

				$$f(x) = \frac{x +1}{x^2 + 2x  +1}$$
		\end{enumerate}	

		% Q7 TODO
		\item Sketch by hand, on the same axes, the graphs of the following
			functions.

		\begin{enumerate}
			\item $f(x) = x$

			\item $g(x) = x^2$

			\item $h(x) = x^3$

			\item $j(x) = x^4$
		\end{enumerate}

		% Q8 TODO
		\item Draw, by hand, a rough sketch of the graph of each function.

		\begin{enumerate}
			\item $y = \sin x$

			\item $y = \tan x$

			\item $y = 2^x$

			\item $y = 1/x$

			\item $y = |x|$

			\item $y = \sqrt{x}$
		\end{enumerate}

		% Q9
		\item Suppose that $f$ has domain $A$ and $g$ has domain $B$.

		\begin{enumerate}
			\item What is the domain of $f + g$?

			The domain of $f + g$ is $A \cap B$


			\item What is the domain of $fg$?

			The domain of $fg$ is $A \cap B$

			\item What is the domain of $f/g$

			The domain of $f/g$ is $A \cap B, g \ne 0$ 
			
		\end{enumerate}

		% Q10
		\item How is the composite function $f \dot g$ defined? What is
			its domain?
